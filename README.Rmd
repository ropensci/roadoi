roadoi interacts with the [Unpaywall REST API](https://unpaywall.org/products/api), 
an openly available web-interface which returns metadata about open access versions of scholarly works. 

This client supports the most recent API Version 2.

API Documentation: <https://unpaywall.org/products/api>

## How do I use it? 

Use the `oadoi_fetch()` function in this package to get open access status
information and full-text links from Unpaywall.


```{r}
roadoi::oadoi_fetch(dois = c("10.1038/ng.3260", "10.1093/nar/gkr1047"), 
                    email = "najko.jahn@gmail.com")
```

There are no API restrictions. However, providing an email address is required and a rate limit of 100k is suggested. If you need to access more data, use the [data dump](https://unpaywall.org/products/snapshot) instead.

### RStudio Addin

This package also has a RStudio Addin for easily finding free full-texts in RStudio.
