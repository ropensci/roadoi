Description: This web client interfaces Unpaywall <https://unpaywall.org/products/api>, formerly
    oaDOI, a service finding free full-texts of academic papers by linking DOIs with 
    open access journals and repositories. It provides unified access to various data sources 
    for open access full-text links including Crossref and the Directory of Open Access 
    Journals (DOAJ). API usage is free and no registration is required.
